Program requirements
----------------------------
* Chrome - Tested on Version 100.0.4896.127 (Official Build) (64-bit)
* Chrome Driver - Tested on ChromeDriver Version 100.0.4896.60
    https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/downloads

* Edited config.cfg file with location of chromedriver file, username (ie phone number), and password.


Python Modules Needed
----------------------------
* selenium (needs to be installed)
* configparser
* time
* datetime
* pytz (needs to be installed)
* csv
* os

How to install python modules 
----------------------------
1) Install python 
2) Open start menu and type "cmd". This will open a command prompt.
3) In that command prompt, type "pip install selenium". This will install the selenium webdriver module.
4) In that same command prompt, type "pip install pytz". This will install the timezone module.

Program logic
----------------------------
1) Starts by reading in config.cfg file in same directory as the script and declares all needed variables.
2) Checks if there is already a csv file already created with the name from the config file. If there is one, it will append to it. If there is not, it will create one.
3) Get current program start time.
4) Please donate :D
5) Starts chrome browser with the chromedriver file. The location of the chromedriver file needs to be provided in the config.cfg file.
6) Begins to login to cotps using the username and password from the config.cfg file.
7) Once it authenticates, it will goto the transaction hall page. Depending on the speed of the internet or the webpage, the variable "refreshtime", may need to be increased. This variable is how long the program will wait for the webpage or actions to load. If you have a lot of errors with this program, I recommend to increase this number. I have gotten it to work with as low as 8, but I found my sweet spot to be 10.
8) The program will then get the current wallet information.
9) If the "In Transaction" is not 0, it will wait. This time between wallet checks can be modified by changing the "timebetweenchecks" variable of the config.cfg file.
10) If the "In Transaction" is 0, the program will attempt to get an order by clicking the "immediate competition for orders" button and then the "Sell" button.
11) The program will then gather the order details and then click the "Confirm" button.
12) It will continue steps 10 and 11 until there is less than $5 left in the wallet.
13) It will then start the "timebetweenchecks" wait until the "In Transaction" reaches 0 again.

Starting the Program
----------------------------
Then goto cotps.py location and type "python cotps.py"
